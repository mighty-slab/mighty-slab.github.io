	<p>I find it quite interesting how one "statistic" can lead to such drastic changes in society and civilisation. With lower child mortality rates, people can finally focus on their productivity and the betterment of their community. Unfortunately and somewhat ironically, it's common knowledge that places with high child mortality also tend to have drastically higher childbirth rates as to compensate.The struggles and the terrible loss families have to go through due to this international tragedy is nothing anyone should go through, and I find it uplifting to see that this issue seems to trend downwards. Hopefully,  one day this issue will be of the distant past.</p><br><br><br>
